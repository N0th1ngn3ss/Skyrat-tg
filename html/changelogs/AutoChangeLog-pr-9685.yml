changes: 
  - bugfix: "Torches and all those other light sources that shouldn't make a flashlight sound when turned on, should no longer make that noise upon being turned on."
  - bugfix: "Desk lamps now properly start the round lit when they're meant to be lit."
  - bugfix: "Lanterns burn oil, yellow slime extract flashlights are reacting to being squeezed, and therefore they do not need a power cell. So they shouldn't have one, and no longer have one."
  - refactor: "Refactored the flashlight code to make all of its features actually work, at long last."
